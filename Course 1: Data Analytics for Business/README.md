In course 1 of the London School of Economics' Data Analytics Career Accelerator, we were tasked with doing some analysis for the stakeholders of the fictional supermarket '2Market' using a variety of tools.

## Assignment Scenario

You are a data analyst working with 2Market, a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour. 

In particular, 2Market wants to understand:

 - The demographics of their customers 
 - Which advertising channels seem to be the most effective
 - Which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic

To support 2Market, you’ll:

 - Complete your analysis and create a dashboard: You’ll analyse data and create a dashboard that includes key metrics to inform decision-making (such as the average revenue from each marketing channel.)
 - Complete a report: You’ll write a report explaining your approach and any insights discovered.
